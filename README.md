# Github Notes

my very first repository. Random notes for GitHub useage follow below:

This was simply a test-run on creating a repository and learning about Branching as well as Commits. Branching is to make changes to the Master branch, and you push them onto the Master branch. Commits are saved changes with a short description as to why the changes were made.

GITHUB Doesn't like empty folders. In order for my "foodgo.css" casc. style sheets file to be read/used, i had to make a folder (i called it doc) in my main folder of the repository.
I made the index.html file read it by the following line:
 <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/foodgo.css">
This way, the index.html file will look under the doc folder for the css file
